- The provided README file says that there are 316 instances, however
	the provided data consists of two files:
		data: 307 exs
		test: 376 exs
	I don't know if the test exs overlap with the data exs.
  I've just converted the `data' file.

- The Irvine data also has a smaller data set of 47 examples which I've
	ignored.

- The conversion is straightforward.
