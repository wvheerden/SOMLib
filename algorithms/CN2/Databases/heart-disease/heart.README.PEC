This database comes with four different sets of data, only two which 
were in a form suitable for ID/CN. The conversion to Turing's CN/ID format
was straightforward.

The original problem had five class values (0,1,2,3,4), but as recommended
in the README file I've converted this to a two-class problem:
	0 = absence of heart-disease
	1-4 = presence
