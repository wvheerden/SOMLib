PLATFORMS
=========
The CN2 source and executable has been tested on 
	- Sun Workstation under SunOS4.*. 

Rick Kufrin (NCSA) has recently made some minor changes to the software
to allow it to work on other platforms. He reports the modified files
appear to work on:
	- SunOS 4.1.3 (with and without old-style ioctl requests)
	- Solaris 5.4
	- IRIX 5.3 (Silicon Graphics)
	- HP-UX A.09.05 (Hewlett-Packard)
also
	- Linux 1.2.8: **see APPENDIX 2 below for more info**
	- Windows XP: **see APPENDIX 3 below for more info**

***The modified files are in the directory MultiPlatform***. To 
recompile with these updated files, move them over the original
source files and recompile. I've put these updated files in a separate
directory to preserve the original, well-tested CN and also allow
people to use other platforms if needed.

Also, see Appendix 2 and 3 below for further Linux and Windows XP information.

To make including these updates, type:
	% cd cn2		      (cn2 is the dir where you unloaded the distrn)
	% mv -f MultiPlatform/* .     (if you want these updates included)
	% make

Many thanks to Rick Kufrin for making these changes available, and for
Johannes Fuernkranz for sharing how to port to Windows XP!!

Hi,

I managed to get CN2 running on Cygwin under Windows XP. It required one 
non-trivial hack, which I found on the net. Attached is what I did. If 
you think it could be useful for others, feel free to include it in the 
README or something. If not, just dump it. :-)

[Cygwin is a UNIX-like environment that runs under all Windows enviroments. 
 You need to install that first, and then I hope that the procedure I 
 followed should also work for you.
	Cygwin is available from http://www.cygwin.com/ ]

regards, Juffi

How I got CN2 running on cygwin (Windows XP):

- use the version in the MultiPlatform directory
- Makefile: substitute all cc calls with gcc
- Makefile: install bison, use bison -y instead of yacc
- Makefile: install flex, use library -lfl instead of -ll
- Makefile: CFLAGS -DHAVE_LOG2, possibly also -DHAVE_FLOAT_H, but not
            -D_USE_TIOCSTI
- lex.yy.c: patch line 20 in the following way:

/* FILE *yyin = {stdin}, *yyout = {stdout}
fix for cygwin: http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/1998-q2/msg00155.html
 */

FILE *yyin, *yyout;
static void yyin_construct (void) __attribute__((constructor));
static void yyin_construct (void) { yyin = stdin; }
static void yyout_construct (void) __attribute__((constructor));
static void yyout_construct (void) { yyout = stdout; }

It worked for me. Your mileage may vary...   Juffi
