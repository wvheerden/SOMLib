SIMPLE 5 MINUTE TUTORIAL
========================
There are three toy example domains to briefly illustrate the data format for 
CN2, stored in the examples subdirectory. Two data files are needed: (i) a
declaration of the data types of each attribute, and (ii) the examples (one
per line). By convention these have .att and .exs filename extensions.

To use cn2 for the "traffic" domain (say) do:
	 % cd Examples
         % ../cn
         CN> r            % (for read)
         READ> a          % (for attributes)
         Filename? traffic.att
         CN> r
         READ> e          % (for examples)
         Filename? traffic.exs
         CN> i            % to induce some rules
         CN> w            % to write the rules to a file
         Filename? traffic.rul
         CN> q            % quit
also
         CN> ?            % gives online help

Also, the Databases subdirectory contains some additional databases in CN2
format for you to experiment with.
