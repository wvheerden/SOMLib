/**
 * <p>
 * The GFSR4 generator is like a lagged-fibonacci generator, and
 * produces each number as an `xor''d sum of four previous values.
 * </p><pre>
 *     r_n = r_{n-A} ^^ r_{n-B} ^^ r_{n-C} ^^ r_{n-D}
 * </pre><p>
 * Ziff notes that "it is now widely known" that two-tap registers have serious
 * flaws, the most obvious one being the three-point correlation that
 * comes from the definition of the generator.  Nice mathematical
 * properties can be derived for GFSR's, and numerics bears out the
 * claim that 4-tap GFSR's with appropriately chosen offsets are as
 * random as can be measured, using the author's test.
 * </p><p>
 * This implementation uses the values suggested the the example on
 * p392 of Ziff's article: A=471, B=1586, C=6988, D=9689
 * </p><p>
 * If the offsets are appropriately chosen (such the one ones in this
 * implementation), then the sequence is said to be maximal.  I'm not
 * sure what that means, but I would guess that means all states are
 * part of the same cycle, which would mean that the period for this
 * generator is astronomical; it is (2^K)^D approx 10^{93334} where
 * K=32 is the number of bits in the word, and D is the longest lag.
 * This would also mean that any one random number could easily be
 * zero; ie 0 <= r < 2^32.
 * </p><p>
 * Ziff doesn't say so, but it seems to me that the bits are
 * completely independent here, so one could use this as an efficient
 * bit generator; each number supplying 32 random bits.  The quality
 * of the generated bits depends on the underlying seeding procedure,
 * which may need to be improved in some circumstances.
