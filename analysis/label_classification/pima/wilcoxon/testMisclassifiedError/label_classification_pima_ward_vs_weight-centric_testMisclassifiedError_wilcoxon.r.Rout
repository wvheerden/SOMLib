	Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction

data:  a and b 
V = 94.5, p-value = 0.02272
alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 

Warning messages:
1: In wilcox.test.default(a, b, alternative = "two.sided", paired = TRUE,  :
  cannot compute exact p-value with ties
2: In wilcox.test.default(a, b, alternative = "two.sided", paired = TRUE,  :
  cannot compute exact p-value with zeroes
